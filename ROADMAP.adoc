= Ephapax Roadmap

== Current Status

Affine compiler stage compiles end-to-end (Idris2 -> S-expr -> WASM) with a
locked surface syntax and a smoke test in CI.

== Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Foundation
* [x] Locked surface syntax
* [x] Idris2 affine parser + typechecker
* [x] IR emit + backend alignment (S-expr tags + wasm path)
* [x] End-to-end affine compile to WASM
* [x] Smoke CI workflow
* [x] Usability pass (syntax doc + smoke)
* [ ] Parser + typechecker test suite
* [ ] Error diagnostics with spans

=== v1.0.0 - Stable Release
* [ ] Linear stage parity with affine
* [ ] Comprehensive test suite + conformance harness
* [ ] Backend feature coverage (strings, regions, sums/products, borrow)
* [ ] Production ready

== Future Directions

_To be determined based on community feedback._
