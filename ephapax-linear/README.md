# Ephapax Linear Toolchain

This directory is the fresh start you requested for the My Language family in an **ephapax linear** workflow. The old workspace is archived at `~/my-lang-archive`. Here’s the new scaffold:

- `grammar/` – place the canonical Solo (and subsequent dialect) grammars here.
- `docs/` – research, roadmap, and dialect specs.
- `src/` – parser/toolchain code skeleton (to be built in the ephapax linear style you prefer).

Next actions:
1. Copy the Solo v1.0 grammar into `grammar/solo-v1-grammar.ebnf` (or a linear version if desired).
2. Build the parser pipeline in the language/framework you choose (we can start with the ephapax linear parser module inside `src/`).
3. Re-use the artifacts from the archive `~/my-lang-archive` as reference while rewriting semantics, typing, and runtime pieces.

Let me know how you want to proceed with the new ephapax linear parser (language, style, core modules), and I’ll scaffold the remaining structure accordingly.
